<span style="font-size:20px;">SportsCloud is a place for athletes and fitness enthusiasts to discover new exercise routines, discover healthy options for delicious foods, and explore clothing options for the sports they play. We were inspired to create this page because of our shared love for sports and fitness. Fitness can greatly impact mental health and make you an all around happier person. We hope that SportsCloud can help inspire other people to exercise and live a better, nutritious life. </p>

 <span style="font-size:20px;">One woman in tech who has inspired us to create this website is Erin Parker. She has founded the company “Spitfire Athlete”.She has always been passionate about fitness, and specifically wanted to empower women, which is similar to our mission. In an interview with Hackbright Academy, Parker said that “Spitfire Athlete “happened” because three of my life passions just happened to collide in a very meaningful way – my passion for strength training, my passion for building great products, and my passion for empowering women”.We were inspired by Erin Parker, and we hope other women will be too.
