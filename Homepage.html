<span style="font-size:20px;">One woman in tech who has inspired us to create this website is Erin Parker. She has founded the company “Spitfire Athlete”. She has always been passionate about fitness, and specifically wanted to empower women, which is similar to our mission. In an interview with Hackbright Academy, Parker said that “Spitfire Athlete “happened” because three of my life passions just happened to collide in a very meaningful way – my passion for strength training, my passion for building great products, and my passion for empowering women”.We were inspired by Erin Parker, and we hope other women will be too.
