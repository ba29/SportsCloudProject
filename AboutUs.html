<h1>About Us</h1>
<h2> Bianca Agosto </h2>
<p> I am a rising junior at BHSEC.  I am from Brooklyn, New York.  Growing up, sports have always been a big hobby of mine.  I’ve been playing sports from a young age so I was interested in making a platform for other athletes and “sports lovers”.  With this website, people can explore clothing options for their sport, learn about new fitness routines, and be a part of open discussions about different topics in sports. </p>

<h2> Caitlin Clifford </h2>
<p> I am a junior from NYC. I was inspired to make this page because I have always been a big sports fan and athlete. Fitness/exercise puts everyone into a good mood and I wanted other people to experience the happiness I get from sports. Currently, I play lacrosse and tennis. My favorite sports teams are the New York Rangers, New England Patriots, New York Mets, and the New York Knicks. During the hockey season, I rarely miss a game and love to meet the players.  </p>

<h2> Vivian Zhao </h2>
<p>  I am a rising senior at NDHS, a school in Staten Island. I love running, so I decided to join  the track and field team at school. Sports takes my mind off stressful things in life, such as school and my future. </p>

<h2> Sadia Afrin </h2>
<p> I am a rising junior at Newtown high school. I was inspired to make this page to encourage women to workout and stay fit. I believe that physical health has a great impact on mental health and when we look good, we feel great. </p>
